Precambrian Time
----------------
2. The continents formed by the breaking up of the supercontinent due 
    to plate tectonics (continental drift).

3. Banded iron formations are alternating layers of iron-rich minerals in Proterozoic rocks.
    Common layer constituents are magnetite and silica.

4. Cryogenic period - 720 Ma - 635 Ma. Because there were 2 glaciations during the 
    Cryogenic period.

5. Red beds are sedimentary rocks (typically consisting of sandstone, siltstone, shale).
    They are red in color due to the presence of ferric oxides. It showed the rise in
    oxygen levels in the atmosphere, probably due to photosynthesis.

6. Till - Unsorted glacial sediment formed from the erosion of materials by the glacier
    Tillite - When till is lithified by subsequent burial into solid rock, it is tillite.

7. C, N, O, H. Chemical reactions.
    Creation of multicellular organisms (cell division), photosynthesis (creation of oxygen), GOD
